## Project 01 - Get to Know Your Tools
A simple project demonstrating basic electrical theory and a simple circuit built from an LED, resistor and push button in both series and parallel.

*No code is used for this project and as a result no directory is preset in this repository.*

## Project 02 - Starship Interface
A project demonstrating the basics of programming with an Arduino board using variables, functions and if()...else statements to read the state of an input and control outputs.
